			A samosa is a fried or baked pastry with a savory filling, such as spiced potatoes, onions, peas, cheese, beef and other meats, or lentils. It may take different forms, including triangular, cone, or half-moon shapes, depending on the region. The South Asian style, often accompanied by chutney, is probably the most widely known of a broad family of recipes from Africa to China, which has origins in medieval times or earlier.</p>

		Chole bhature is often eaten as a breakfast dish, sometimes accompanied with lassi. It can also be street food or a complete meal and may be accompanied with onions, pickled carrots, green chutney or achaar.</p>

		<p id="p3">Pakoras are created with main ingredients, usually but not exclusively vegetables, dipped in a batter made from gram flour (chickpea/garbanzo bean flour) with spices, then deep fried.<br>

		Common varieties of pakora use onion, eggplant, potato, spinach, plantain, paneer, cauliflower, tomato, or chili pepper, but other foodstuffs can be made into pakoras such as meat or fish. There is no standard recipe, so the spices used are up to the cook and may be chosen due to local tradition or availability; often these include fresh and dried spices such as chilli, fenugreek and coriander. There are pakora variants that use other flours, such as buckwheat flour.
